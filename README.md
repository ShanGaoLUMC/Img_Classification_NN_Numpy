# Application of Deep Neural Network for Cat Image Classification

This script is a self-summarizing version for completing Cat Image Classification project of Andrew Ngâ€™s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. This script has been tested and it works well on my local machine. In order to do so, I downloaded the necessary project files from the course kernel, and installed the Anaconda Python 3.6, the nice thing of Anaconda is that it already includes a lot of popular data science libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook etc. 

### Skills to develop:
* Implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
* Build a 2-layer and a 5-layer neural network models with Numpy, Python.
* Train and apply these models to classify cat vs non-cat images.
